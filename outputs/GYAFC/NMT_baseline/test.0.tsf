i mean you have to be her friend .
are you asking a question ?
i don & apos ; t mean to be mean .
because some girls send hints messages to guys not as clear .
let us buy coffee and speak from that point !
and i hate it when my dad is unhappy .
ask him if you should go see a doctor .
he probably has lots of things to worry about right now .
but i don & apos ; t think he will cheat or leave you because of sex .
will i always feel that way ?
but he might enjoy all the waiting , dream and flirting .
and i would like to try again .
some guys shave it depends on the woman .
well if you really like this guy then smile and talk nicely to him .
i don & apos ; t know if he loves you but he likes you .
i mean , women are complete .
i realize i don & apos ; t know what i mean , how can i stop this ?
do that sound like a girly .
sometimes if the good news the bad , then its worth it .
that is if both of you agree to do this .
well why do you like the one boy who picks on you ?
also guys think that they don & apos ; t need you that bad until you & apos ; re gone .
but if a guy likes you , don & apos ; t be afraid to say bad .
do i want to be in love ?
they will think you are sticking if you look at them .
i think your right its confusing
how do i get my boyfriend to show me that he loves me .
that is if you really love them .
don & apos ; t sell yourself , even if he & apos ; s rich .
you sound like a very nice person so don & apos ; t allow these women to make you feel bad .
i don & apos ; t know but i know another profile that i visit .
i really want you to think about how to be confident women .
without being a relationship that might be a little sluts .
he asked if i want to use his charactor .
never let a guy envy you .
absolutly not , he & apos ; s too narrow and i & apos ; m just 55
you can tell him if he says yes .
what was the mistake you took part in ?
old has a song about this , it & apos ; s called & apos ; only your mother throws you .
why are we in a relationship if our partner treats us bad after we fall in love ?
if you have experienced it , what was it like ?
it & apos ; s not a turn off if she drinks too much .
if thats want you want .
it & apos ; s like getting rid of a drug habit .
wow i should do that next time i am dating
what is your desire , though ?
sounds like you both are comfortable with how things are now .
don & apos ; t let her behind your life , she & apos ; ll just have to learn to deal with it .
if he doesn & apos ; t go out with you , don & apos ; t worry there are plenty of other options .
no guy gave you everything you want .
if you want to stay married you need to find yourself .
start with a simple common question and go from there .
go to a place where you are .
trust him and dont bring the matter up again .
im still trying to work up my nerves to try that out .
find the one who loves you too .
i will be your man and you come to me town .
stay the way away from this guy .
you don & apos ; t hate one , i hate them all , to say the least .
i would say like 3 or 4
he has been told that to some young woman .
i knew all my former girlfriends were not the one until i met my wife .
don & apos ; t try to have both of them at once , whatever you do .
sex is not the only thing in life !
i have a yahoo email address and thats better for me
for me , fun , food meals .
but he was a little busy afterwards .
that will just be sex .
don & apos ; t approach her and let her know you find her looks hot .
sounds like your going thru plenty of things right now .
but you should ask a girl about the question since im a boy .
i always felt the same way but my views changed when i met my true love !
best friend is a good choice to marry in nobody works out
i don & apos ; t want to go out and ask , will you go out with me ?
unless you know him well , you are comparing yourself out there to get hurt .
if its not good or bad .
they annoy you all over the day .
either go to texas or pay someone .
i can just stop caring about him and forget about him like he meant nothing to me .
is it like a clear then that turns blue when it cuts ?
it & apos ; s a turn off if she sits on your best friend & apos ; s lap .
he had a control personality .
thats one of the gifts we can give ourselves .
you should get married only after you have been with a guy for at least two years .
hey and hugs to all my guys at 307 !
just be yourself when you are imagining her .
i have no idea what your trying to say .
a guy asked if i would mind touching him .
why would some men do that ?
a few good women are left , you just have to look in the right places .
move on or work it out with your partner .
get a hold of yourself , how could you love someone you don & apos ; t even talk to ?
find a good girl who is pretty .
that doesn & apos ; t mean that you & apos ; re faking .
its the only time in your life you can live out true love !
you will have to find your answer .
give them 2 months and they will get over you .
then you will not see the color .
he probably wants to know if you like him .
if she doesn & apos ; t want you anymore .
you & apos ; re not a hoe , so don & apos ; t worry .
no way to force someone to like you .
break up and keep yourself open
have you had a firing zone ?
i can just say yes and mention that i an proud and have long black hair .
i have a friend like that .
i don & apos ; t know , maybe your young .
hi my name is going to go out with this person for years .
if you honestly love him you will tell him .
if you really like her , go with your emotions .
think about whether you can really afford it and if you want to , then go forward .
get your old life back so you can stay alive .
dude , what your saying is she doesn & apos ; t .
don & apos ; t flirt , that doesn & apos ; t work .
maybe some women would say that it hurts alot .
if i were mad it would be easier to do .
if they have , then move on .
you are getting played so you don & apos ; t get to watch tv for a month .
tell him and it wouldn & apos ; t seem psycho because you have to know each other for a while .
its really complicated could you please explain it again in short terms ?
give them a chance to discover all of you .
unless it & apos ; s with the wrong guy .
my boyfriend loves me very much and doesnt want to lose me .
if they are brunette or not what matters .
after a while it has to be played out .
everyone , even if they don & apos ; t admit it , likes to be told they are sexy .
i like to go dancing at clubs in harms zone .
good luck but remember to do your homework
i prefer natural , not a full face of makeup .
if you like the guy , try it .
we are now just divorced .
someone said women don & apos ; t have feelings ?
actions are better than words .
i have been going out with a really nice pink jersey but what should it be along ?
watch for if he dribbles , calls an ipod mail or even cares .
never ignore her listen to her and dont change the subject
he & apos ; s my only money until i college from college .
she will tell you if its not ok .
i don & apos ; t think i mind , either way .
don & apos ; t eat in the same place you do .
trying to get some blonde furniture too .
don & apos ; t worry about him , concentrate on your classes , and you boyfriend .
i don & apos ; t think i should have done that .
sex is important and should last , at the bare
what is a special gift i can give my grip on his birthday ?
try to be yourself and don & apos ; t act fare .
if they don & apos ; t then you will have to continue with your life .
first kiss , but should be heaven .
in a family life is the most beautiful
most of all , be genuine .
i know three guys i can do that with .
it & apos ; s ok to jump on him if he & apos ; s flirting with her .
just stick with the boys who are either 13 or 14 .
tell him you just want to be friends with him .
that is good , its like getting your father & apos ; s bless .
unless you are very desperate wait for him to ask you out .
if he says it means sex is his only goal .
i would enjoy having some fun with you thats why i answered this stupid question .
do you feel like that ?
give your brother some money and tell him that he should leave .
maybe he will call you .
something you can do is imagine your life with out him / her .
i pick the domestic zone .
do you love her deeply ?
men get bored before women do .
save money with respect to flowers .
if you are not happy then you need to fix it or leave .
just because he has great to be a good bf doesn & apos ; t mean he will be .
you can do a paternity court .
having a big penis doesn & apos ; t mean you are good in bed .
yes it looks pretty beautiful on almost any woman .
men have issues with sharing .
yes it depends on the guy
people had asked me why was i rushing ?
both of them dont respect your feelings .
even though i see him each week and i can & apos ; t find the guts to talk to him .
i don & apos ; t find a guy looks like that .
i like guys who shave their legs .
is it just just curious ?
i think they do .
its a wrong decision that can & apos ; t be overcome !
i lost my virginity in a park when i was 16
they have never met in person but she says they are in love .
ask him if he wants to dance with you .
live life to the fullest and have faith .
i don & apos ; t know if you fell down , but i want to have sex .
he knows you like him so just ask him out .
just tell him you are afraid and tell him .
i wouldn & apos ; t drive for 5 hours just to hang out with someone unless i liked her alot .
her friend talk to her on the phone .
play sports with your guy friends .
you feel happy love , you feel happy , nice , and just on that person .
i can & apos ; t picture my life without my husband .
we seem to always push the ones that we love .
if you are older , then go for it .
i use the mean guy & apos ; man & apos ; .
personally , i prefer a , & amp ;
any girl looks hot when standing looking hot .
it has happened to me and now im dating .
just be honest about your feelings .
show her your naked pics pictures .
why do people look for marriage ?
we & apos ; ve in the hood of my car moon
why should men grow up if women expect men to act like that ?
do this a few times to get comfortable .
having sex is like a fantasy .
right now , i think he & apos ; s mad , upset and won & apos ; t be with you .
if anyone knows the answer please let me know .
black stands for death and so on .
i like someone with some weight because i feel cheated with a thin one .
if you don & apos ; t know ask someone who has the answer .
his tries to make it up to you .
the one that pick on you guys like you .
ok i have liked this girl since i was in the 6th grade .
did you see her looking at you ?
i never knew life could be so great .
what is best for the both of you ?
at least she didn & apos ; t give you a fake number .
so , you & apos ; re not a whore .
but let them get married if they cant control themselves .
she calls him all the time .
why bother if you are already doing it ?
many times you have loved a guy , but werent sure if he loved you back .
should i break up with him because of his mom ?
make a nice move and if there is no advance she is not interested .
i have friends that get married after 6 months of dating .
get her to your head .
you will look silly , you will look silly .
thats a culture that has things right .
if you don & apos ; t ask this question , you will always wonder about the answer .
i would suggest not worrying about it .
what the worst thing that could happen ?
i & apos ; m confused and don & apos ; t know what to do because i hate for the girl to be that way .
find someone who doesn & apos ; t hate you .
but don & apos ; t be a jerk .
some guys just have no intention on dancing .
this is not an idiot .
it depends on if you could trust him .
fat and fat guys just accept what they can get .
people choose to be husbands and wives for reasons .
its not worth it if all you do is argue
have a good time in jail asking your cell mate
are you asking if i like you ?
how did you kiss ?
females have discussed about sex with other girls , even though !
8 to 27 is fine and she doesnt have to be younger than you .
when that happens , your decision will be easier to make .
he cheated , but i think i can lift or carry my husband .
try to make the best out of a bad situation .
are you looking for friendship ?
i think he would make a great valentine .
this is hard due to the many temptations .
does it take a year to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship ?
it will depend on when you are ready .
of course i would love to meet women .
it & apos ; s just the way things are .
its ok to be friends online but there should be limits .
can you imagine starting a family with him ?
if he says no , he & apos ; s just too low to start with .
to tell the truth you will learn but you have to experience things
you married your husband because you love him .
i know i have someone who will be waiting when i come home .
get away from it , go enjoy a massage .
i don & apos ; t know where to start .
depends , are you a hot guy ?
are you talkin about your avatar ?
if a guy cares about you then he will call .
i think there is a big difference between having sex & apos ; and making love
you don & apos ; t need to stay together , even if you have a child .
are you a young woman from a tobacco attitude or from a pedophile ?
getting married and have kids can be realistic but you can & apos ; t be .
i have never went out with it .
do you want to be with the same guy ?
how often can you have sex with pamela anderson ?
you should make sure that your point doesn & apos ; t lead her hate you .
this just hits too close to close to me , my mom also too .
i love to run my fingers through tommy hair .
i mean to the two of you .
the right woman will come along if you are patient .
i want my wife to grow too .
he is obviously shy , maybe you should make a move .
the doctor was surprised too .
maybe you think it & apos ; s a no , but it & apos ; s a yes .
guys don & apos ; t , only little boys .
maybe ask if they want to go out sometime soon .
it happens to me twice .
don & apos ; t go out with a guy because you feel the & apos ;
you wouldn & apos ; t be asking if you really wanted to be with him .
and i just pray that it never goes !
most women are waiting for a guy to tell her true feelings .
women are more horny during sex .
try to impress her .
instead of my lips and kissing me gently on only forehead .
im not that type of person but i know plenty of people like that .
ok it depends on how deep you are starting to feel like this boy !
thanks for the convo .
why do they want to be married ?
we like to be a punch softly , with some sort of fights .
i want a trip to a park park or a jersey
i have feelings for a person and need to know if i am in love .
do you like fake nails or fake nails ?
first , plan what you want and don & apos ; t worry about what everyone else wants .
i don & apos ; t know what you mean .
i like the perfume that you wear .
i think most guys dont care but it depends on the person .
it has nothing to do with being held , young or msn .
don & apos ; t get married so early in the relationship .
you are not a good person to cheat on your wife .
be the best version of yourself and if he is good looking he will talk to you .
you don & apos ; t want to be with anyone , but that person .
he & apos ; s getting married , quit on it .
did you tell her the annoying nature of her everyday with you ?
when i move in i was asked out my neighbor .
most caucasion boys like teen girls like sex .
he played a good game of basketball .
don & apos ; t worry about it at all .
are you someone who likes fighting and fighting ?
the most important thing is not trying to do the person that cheated you .
one guy willing to move 20 and 9 miles just to be with me .
have you seen a doctor yet ?
maybe she & apos ; s not a struggle , but the skinny woman definately was .
get a active life and not waste my time .
it & apos ; s pretty good to fill in chocolate and wonder because you have gain weight .
i lived there and he was there .
if he & apos ; s single , go for it .
if you don & apos ; t like this , they usually become the kind who beat their wives .
are you or you don & apos ; t like him ?
if you are sure , then tell your parents , you have not already done so .
alot of people will probably say no .
do you think he likes you ?
some guys only say that word if they mean it .
it seems like he likes you and should show him how you feel .
i think everyone should keep their own name
friends are forever , guys come and go .
try to imagine that it was love .
i think you should be ready even if you & apos ; re with the four seasons .
all guys like girls that type and others not as much .
if you want kids , then be a filler .
younger men and older women good idea or not ?
he wants to continue .
so there is no way to deal about love .
and your throat is very important .
i say those things and i am a girl .
trust me , girls can be just as perverted .
flowers are nice even if the don & apos ; t last long .
there are movies that i have yet to see .
she is a very sweet girl , just the person you are looking for !
try to use your brain and not your manhood , maybe she doesn & apos ; t love you .
no disrespect offense , but that sounds like a lady & apos ; s name .
i wouldn & apos ; t take the trouble to call him .
no girls i like in my list so i choose my neighbors spouse
if you have trust , then talk about it .
don & apos ; t listen to anyone else & apos ; s advice .
what do i do to work with her ?
give them a rose and express ur love for them
it & apos ; s weird , but it & apos ; s nothing bad .
you need to see what & apos ; s right for you .
they are women enough for a guy , but they aren & apos ; t as torn as us .
hey , especially when she became sick .
i can & apos ; t help any further without more info .
kissing is something you can & apos ; t do wrong or right .
take a time to decide .
pick yourself up with guy friends .
i would say it & apos ; s more of a trust issue .
i need someone to help me out .
then move on if he still doesn & apos ; t like you .
he probably isn & apos ; t interested either .
try to make it yourself anytime
can you do anything else besides and fix things ?
i told her i loved her .
it seems that all the guy senior girls think that bad girls are sluts , which bad .
so how do i just kiss him ?
if you check in the deleted things it should be there .
hope you find a nice girl to date .
i don & apos ; t think that & apos ; s a good idea , you & apos ; re not there for that .
its a very long list .
i would say brokeback mountain , you will be happy even if its a guy .
if you don & apos ; t on sex , then it & apos ; s ok .
yes , and it & apos ; s a load of lube to catch at the marriage .
hang on and stay strong luck !
besides , not pay for friends .
if you know what it is , then don & apos ; t do it .
now i am married now .
i think its totally depends on age and butt .
once you have kids you will have to decide on a last name .
your child will find it hard enough growing up with out a dad .
guys look like kids to me , i don & apos ; t find it attractive .
ask what the score of the last game was .
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex .
best and easiest way is to fly or drive to vegas and get married
of course let me get to know you more .
i prefer a size : or : ) : ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
and lie and lie and get some more more .
they haven & apos ; t done before and the pleasure is twice as nice !
my wife doesn & apos ; t like to wear those commitments .
we don & apos ; t know what you look like .
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life .
i think it is better than my personal life .
don & apos ; t go anywhere with you new date that you went with your ex .
talk with your best friend and see if it is good .
it sounds weird , but it worked for me , about 3 to 5 days .
i don & apos ; t like it when he teases you about the little things .
no because i am not yet married
a lot of guys like chocolates women , they are mostly african .
if you like him then you shouldn & apos ; t care , stay with him .
do they call you when you are with him ?
you shouldn & apos ; t get married if you feel about it .
it really depends if you are not a whore .
move on and start dating someone who doesn & apos ; t hate you .
get to know her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out .
i asked him if he was blowing me off .
maybe some dirty young guys like the younger ladies .
make sure its your decision .
tell him you are looking to keep it casual .
this is a tough one with lots of problems .
they have been pretty good years , not always the easiest .
we have seen eachother , everyday , for about 4 to 5 years .
imagine that im the guy you want and then date me .
it never puts anyone to flirt a little !
stick with what you feel inside .
best of luck to you !
is it bad if i haven & apos ; t kissed the girl i & apos ; ve been with for 8 months ?
it & apos ; s the woman & apos ; s decision ...
i think they look better than many other fish .
it would be ok the day after
see if she is shining for dinner and a movie .
some guys don & apos ; t think of their partner when they just get to it .
ask the question in english i cant understand you
sorry , but i never felt that way .
remember , no finds has ever tried to fly with one tower .
i think about this one thing .
you will never find a boyfriend if you look at him .
i met filled recently and i want to know if she likes me .
don & apos ; t just sit around and wait for the phone to ring .
be quiet and be whatever you want .
if he comes to his feelings , great , if not you should move on .
he might want to kill his father .
take it before its too late .
this girl doesn & apos ; t want a man who shares her .
i want to hear the image of an american woman about this .
please help me win this argument to her !
almost without exception ( not constantly ) those are guys like that , more or less .
when will start to realize this .
i don & apos ; t know what to do .
go to a bar and drink until you are .
i like my best friend .
if you have to ask then that & apos ; s a bad .
don & apos ; t sit there and wait til he finds you are a good one .
i & apos ; m getting divorced , but i & apos ; m still stuck with this .
your girlfriend will only think your being a jerk .
maybe you should try to pursue a young women , by the way .
i went out with my ex for 3 years and he / she cheated .
you will know in time and see what happens for 6 months .
well the one i liked goes something like this .
not all guys break up with their woman .
there is great fun and there are plenty of things to do .
is it ok to kiss on the first date ?
i have a female friend that i am close with .
they lust for each other
my friend says i am too nice and i should tell him no .
but there is always an exception , is there not ?
not all men , but some men do .
so you can still keep your penis .
walk up to her say hi and ask if she is single .
that really turns me off but i ran away .
girls who are chubby can still be hot .
not every thing is going on .
just try to get some tongue and get some tongue with your tongue .
i will pay if i can get your vote for best answer .
look for somewhere in public , where you will feel most comfortable .
flirt with him and see what he reacts .
and it kept the pressure i feel to ask somebody .
tell me you will go out with me .
she doesn & apos ; t forget my mistake .
how do i approach her without her thinking im just another guy with bad intentions ?
as a guy i might have some answers .
don & apos ; t worry you are only 13 .
always go dutch riding with company .
if you two truly love each other you will work things out .
eye contact is the key point .
i can lift him to .
he just has to start over and trust your trust again .
why do you want to ask her out ?
well im hoping you get to check this out .
try playing , just join , just be & apos ; , junk , etc .
wait until you find out and say go from there
that & apos ; s stupid because you need a theory class for that .
just quit if you do eat something like that .
i keep thinking about sex with her .
the only way you will know is if you confront him and ask him .
if you want to ask out , it & apos ; s going to ask .
the relationship is still happening because you have the guts to end things .
it might be interesting for them to learn about that .
he dribbles ... he shoots ... 2 points ...
do guys really like bigger women ?
he loves you too but only time can tell what will happen
if a guy really deserves you he will understand you .
we have started our own christ .
his answer works for me .
you can still love him but you need to move on .
