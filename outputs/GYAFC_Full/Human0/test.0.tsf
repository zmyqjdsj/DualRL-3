and i mean really be her friend .
sounds like a rhetorical question : )
men play at love to get sex , women play at sex to get love .
i do n't want to be mean .
on average id say about 45 % at first but than one you get to knowthe person maybe 15 %
because some women send men tiny messages with out saying it clearly .
lets get coffee and chat and take it from there !
i also hate seeing my dad unhappy .
ask him to go see a doc .
post more questions on yahoo answers !
besides do n't you think he has enough to worry about ?
but i dont htink that by not having sex with him he will become unfaithful or leave you .
anyway my question is ... . will i always feel that way ?
but he might enjoy all the waiting , dreaming & teasing .
and i want to try again .
not all the time , sometimes men shave them , it depends on the woman ,
well if u really like this guy smile and make nice talk with him .
i do n't know about love , but he likes you for sure
i 'd ask you out , but i live in oregon and have no idea where you live ...
i can onli say ... women r complicated ...
i know i 'm overtly picky about people how can i stop it !
it does sound a little girlie .
sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the the good outweighs the bad
that 's if u both agreed on doing this .
one girl michelle , who probably would n't mind being named , spoke up and said she did n't believe in it .
well , if the one boy picks on you , why like him ?
also sometimes guys think they dont need you so bad until your gone .
but if a guy asks u dont be afraid to say no .
do i want to be in love ?
( that 's what i called it ) .. but , why ?
if you look creepy and you look..they 'll all think you 're leering .
confusing ... yeah , i think your right .
how do i get my sweetheart to show me he loves me
if u really really really really really really like them
( even if he is rich , dont sell ur self .
u sound like a very lovely person so dont let some of these gals drag you down .
i dont know.but i know of another website that i go to..
no seriously , think about howmany cocky girls are out there .
without having a boyfriend would be a bit slutty .
then he said do you want some of my chapstick ?
hold her hands , look to her eyes and say it , but only say it if you really love her .
you never let a man mistreat you
nope , he 's too darned big and i 'm too darned weak !
and if he says yes than you can tell him .
what was the mistake that you did
king had a song about this - only your mother loves you ( and see might be jiving too ) .
we fall in love they treat us bad why are we there
and if you have , what was it like ?
if she gets drunk then it is not a turn off .
only if you want it to be .
it 's like breaking a drug habit .
oh man i should do that when im dating next time !
but you do what you want .
it sounds like you are both comfortable with things just the way they are .
do n't let her rule your life , she will just have to learn to deal with it .
if he does n't then there are too many fish in the sea .
no single man can give you what you really want .
that said u need to figure out youself if u want to stay married to him .
start with a basic everyday question and go from there : )
ask if they wan na go somewhere with you .
trust him , do n't bring it up again .
: ) i have n't tried it yet , but i am still trying to get up the nerve ... .
just find one that loves you too .
come to my town ill be your girl ... .
stay 100 miles away from this guy .
it 's your choice not to hate one , i dislike them to say the least .
i would say around 3 or 4
i do n't know ... .how would you like something crammed up your butt ! !
he 's telling that to some gurls too ... he 's a womanizer..
probably because i knew all the girlfriends were not really the one until i met my wife .
and whatever you do , do n't try to have both of them at once .
sex is not the only thing important in life damn it ! ! ! ! !
i have yahoo email and that works for me .
fun includes eating meals ( not breakfast if yo know what i mean ) .
but he was a lil busy after that .
and that will be just s*x !
please do n't go up to her and tell her how good she looks .
sounds like u r going through a lot right now .
but ask a girl about the sympthoms because i 'm a boy .
i always felt the same way , but i met my true love and my views changed !
guys are stupid ! who knows why they do what they do .
but -- there 's no better person to marry someday than your best friend !
i dont wan na just randomly go up nd be like go out wiht me ?
you sorta stuck yourself out thier to get hurt , unless you know him fairly well .
u need to reput it in add it back just like first time
no good or bad is your personal belief on something .
they bother u all day long .
go to hawaii ... ha ha ha or ... .pay someone ... lol
his/her intelligence , the way they carry themselves , good looks and activeness
i can just toss him to side and forget about him like last night 's trash ... ... ..lol
like clear liquid and turns yellow when dry ?
if she sits on your bestfriends lap because she is drunk then yes it is a turn off .
well if it was before you then he wasnt cheating at all ... obviously .
! he must be a control freak
its one of the gifts we can always give ourselves .
and get married only after you 've been with a guy for more than 2 years .
to all my fellow girls at cone , a big hi and hug !
just be yourself when you are with her .
what the hell r ya talking abt ?
... a guy asks me , 'do you mind if we cuddle ?
but some guys would do that ... why ?
there are lost of good women left you just have to look in the right place .
either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person .
get a grip , how can you love someone that you do n't even communicate with .
find a girl who has talets she also must be prety
it does n't mean that you are slutty .
the one time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love !
you have to search yourself for this one ...
give them 2 months they will get over you .
after a while you dont even see the color .
he is probably wondering if your interested in him at all ... .flirt back ! !
if she is not into you anymore ...
you are definitely not a hoe , do n't worry .
; ) there is no way to make someone fall in love with you .
if you 're asking , then you should break-up w/ and open yourself to other options .
have you ever had a pap smear .
yes all i can say.. but yes , i have long black hair and im proud ! !
i had a friend in the same situation .
maybe your young , i do n't know .
hi , my name is xxxxxx been working for me for years .
i do n't understand someone please give me the answer
if you truely love him you will tell him
just go with your feelings if you like her so much then go with it .
ask yourself and decide.and if you can afford it , do if you want to .
stay alive and get your old life back .
dude , what your sayin is she does n't want to be more than bf and gf ?
do n't use pick up lines , that 's a turn off .
it hurts ... .alot ... maybe some girls might say that 's it ?
tell him what you really want ... that 's what they tell me but never got to do ... speak up ...
( it would be easier to do if i were mad , though ! !
if they have moved on then you should too .
no , you are punish , and no tv for a month
tell him , and it would n't seem psycho cuz u have kno each other for a long time
but thats her way ... you could try it that way or you could just keep your eyes open ...
it is very complcated tell it again please but in simple
give them a chance to discover you .
unless it 's with the wrong man .
my bf loves me to death and doesnt want to give me up .
depends on if they are brunette or not
it 's got to get played out after a while .
everybody likes to be told that they 're hot , even if they do n't admit it !
downtown houston just about any weekend ... lots of clubs ...
good luck but do your homework !
i 'll go with anything natural than fake i even hate the word fake
if you like the guy then go for it .
only now she and i are both divorced .
who said women dont feel anything ?
no matter what he says , action speaks louder then words
i was thinking about a medium pink color , but with what ? ?
see if he calls , e-mails or even cares .
and never ignore her always listen to her ... and when you do do n't change the subjetct women hate that .
i am in college and he is my only sourse of income until i get out .
she will tell you if it 's not ok .
i dont think i mind either way .
do n't eat where you take a s*** .
also try getting some blonde highlights
dont worry about him n just sonsentrate in school so you can lern n then woory bout yer b/f
b ) looks definitely matter , anyone saying they do n't is probably lying .
ohhh this is what i did - big bad mistake on my part .
you give at least 5 minutes for kissing and huging and may be some licking also .
what special gift can i give my would be brother in law for his birthday ?
try to be your self and do n't show off
good luck and i hope everything goes well !
if they dont then you 'll have to get on with your life .
but ur first kiss should feel like ur in hevan .
i feel this is most beautiful in a family life .
lol most important ... just be yourself .
i know 3 guys that i can probably get away with doing something like that .
they probobly know you cant really hide that but you should tell your parents
this is doc izzy and i love and adore bigger women !
if he if flurting with her ok jump him .
stick with the 13 & 14 year old boys .. they are easier to control anyway.. lol good luck
tell him that u jst wannabe friends and that u r relly disappointed that he would act so dumb ! ! !
i guess it 's kind of nice , it 's like your dad 's blessing all the way .
wait for him to ask u out unless ur real desprete
i really like this guy , and i do n't know if it 's just a crush , or if i love him ... ...
if he insists , it means he only after sex .
i find if i try real hard i can see things i know are n't there normally there .
i would like to have some fun with u that 's why i answered this stupid question
do u fell that way ?
give your brother some money and tell him to take a hike ! !
maybe he 's going to call you !
a good way is to imagine yourself without him/her .
make it your top priority to see her if you really want to be with her that bad
so i guess i pick domestic goddess .
do u love her in depth ?
also men get bored and tire way before woman do .
a big savings area is flowers .
ill like to visit usa what are the needfull things
if you are n't happy fix it or get out .
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend doesnt mean he is .

i dont like a guy dat does dat all da time .
i think it 's totally hot when a guy shaves his legs .
did turn gay or is it a curiosity thing ?
i myself think that they do .
it is a mistake that ca n't be undone !
in a park when i was 16 i lost my virgenate
they never met but she says they 're in love .
and ask if he wants to dance with you .
and people life is to short live it to the fulliest and have faith
did you fell goog because i want to have sex , but you have to be careful
like i said ; he already knows that you like him , so just take a deep breathe and ask him .
keep away ur fear and tell him .
and im sure as heck not driving 5 hrs just to hang out unless i really really like her .
does she have other friends to gab with on the fone ?
play sports with your guy friends .
when you first fall in love , your gitty , goofy , and silly happy just thinking about that person .
i ca n't see my life without my husband .
we always seem to push the ones taht we love away .
wait til you get older and if you both still feel the same way then go for it !
tell her , girls like to her the truth good luck
do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time .
you are a man < -- - term used lightly ! !
i prefer a & b cups , myself .
any women beside the ugly guys will look hot ...
no 10 years younger , who wants an older women ?
it happened to me and i am now dating that person
just let her know what you feel .
show her your naked baby pictures .
why do gays want to get married ?
on the hood of my car at a waterfront in a light rain it was awesome !
and women also expect guys to act like that , so why should they grow up ?
but you need to do this a few times .
whle making love is like living a fantasy .
as for now i think he is mad , hurt , upset and got over you .
if anyone know let me know
red= love , black = death ect ...
i like thick because i feel cheated with a thin one !
if you do n't know ask someone who would .
then comes the fun part ... he making it up to you : - )
wow , go with the one that picks on you because 9 times out out 10 he likes you
ok i have liked this on girl since i was in ninth grade .
you catch her looking at you ?
i never knew life could be so good ! ! ! !
ok like i really really really like this guy and i dont know if he likes me back .
do whats best for you and he
hey it 's better than her givin u a fake # to call lol !
so in my opinon ur not a hoe !
but if they can not exercise self-control , let them marry .
she calls him all the time .
you are already doing it so why yet bother ?
there are many times that you love the guy but not sure did he love you also .
should i dump him because of his mother
make a kind move , if no responce u know what to do !
i 've heard of friends getting married about 6 months after meeting somebody .
be yourself say whats up and you might get a response
show her what you 're good at .
you will look like an idiot .
finally a culture that has it right .
if you do n't you 'll always wonder .
let me know what you think , thanks
i would n't worry too much about it .
what 's the worst that could happen .
i 'm confused i hate the girl to be like that ... what shall i do ?
preferrably someone who does n't hate you .
stop trying to slap it in everyones face ! ! !
that 's not exactly true ... . it 's just that most girls are discreet about it ...
some guys just do n't like to dance .
this generation is just too stupid .
so you have one baby out of wedlock .
it depends on if you could trust him before !
ugly ( or fat ) guys just take what they can get .
people are husbands and wives for reasons ! ! !
if all you do is argue it 's not worth it..
have fun in jail asking that question to your cell mate .
u are asking do u like me
depending on what you kissed ; )
) women are curious about sex with other women , even me !
20 to 32 ... she does n't have to be younger than you .
simple ... honesty and love and try to true with them
then u can make an easier decision .
pickup lines are tacky..just be yourself and complament her alot..women like that
but he chaeted , so i guess i can lift or carry my husband .
just try and make the best of what 's to come .
depending on what yo uare looking for , freindship only , like .
i think he would make a great valentine .
( this is really hard because there are a lot of temptations out there ) .
is it usually about a year before both people begin 2 feel in that comfortable , boring , stage ? ?
it all depends on when ur ready .
hell ya i would love to meet the ladys ! !
dont try to figure it out thats jus the way it is .
remember being friends with someone online is ok but there are limits .
if u can imagine him as the father of ur children !
if he turns you down , hes not worth it in the first place ! ! ! !
well to tell u tha truth u learn but u have to actually do it .
you married your hubby hopefully because you love him .
well depend on women wot she want
i know i have someone to come home to .
get a massage..and get away from it all..hehe..
i have no idea where to begin ! ! !
that depends ... are you a hottie w/a body ?
r u talking about ur avatar ?
hang out all day together and to top it off touch his feet .
if a guy cares he calls .
if u you act like dat all da time she might think u desperate .
however , i always believed in the fact there 's a huge different between having sex and making love .
first off , i have 4 kids ... .so a homemaker is more work than my job even .
do n't just stay with him for the baby .
are you a country girl or a city girl .
getting married and getting child can wait but studies ca n't .
i have never been to it
the same guy you wan na be in a relationship with ?
how often can you have sex with pam anderson ?
make sure you dont make her hate you just get your point across too her
my mom also has cancer and this just hits to close to home for me .
i love curly hair i like to run my fingers thru it
i mean the both of you together .
u just have to be patient and the right girl will come along .
i want my wife to grow too .
you should probaly make a move because he is obviosly shy
the doctor ca n't even believe it .
if you play w/both at the same time , she will probably f-* # the sh % $ out of you !
practice kissing me were do you live ?
may be u think not but yes ! ! !
may be becaues your name is freakgirl but if you show your face maybe not no hard feelings
no men do n't but little boys do
how about ... would you like to go out with me sometime ?
hell , it happened to me twice .
you should n't go out with a guy because you 'need ' to .
if you really wanted to be with him , you would n't be asking .
and i hope to god it does n't ever pass !
honestly , most girls are just waiting for the guy to tell her how he truly feels .
plus they are more passionate in love makin .
never stop trying to impress her .
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss just on the forehead .
yes im not one of those people but i know there are lots of them
its all about her , and no it shouldnt be something that happends on a first date .
ok it depends on how much your starting to have feelings for this boy !
thanks for the pep in advance !
why do they want to be married ? ? ?
we like soft approch and a lil bit of chasing .
i married my guy anyways and do you know why ( besides love ) .
-a trip to amusement park such as roller coaster or even theatrical museum .
i like sos and need to know if im in love
do you like fake nails or manicured ones ?
only two points to make friends 1 .
but now we do all these things together and i dont know what to do..
i do n't know what u mean .
i asked him if he still liked me and he said yes but he did n't act like it .
well , you , and that sexy perfume you wear ! !
practice to unrap starburst wrappers with your tounge , the girls love it !
it really depends on the guy but i think most guys seriously do n't care .
i ca n't explain it ... and no , it has nothing to do with them looking young , vulnerable or submissive .
as everyone said ... dont get married so early .
if you plan on cheating on your wife ... you 're a freaking pig and need to be shot !
then be your best self , if he 's impressed or likes you he 'll talk back
you dont want anyone else but that person ever
do n't persue it , he is getting married .
have you told her that it 's kind of irritating with her having to check up on you everyday ?
so , when i moved in my neighbor asked me out .
most teen boyz prefer girls that like sex .
he dribbles ... he shoots ... he scores ... 2 points ...
if not , then do n't sweat it !
do you like to argue and fight ? ? ?
if he really did n't like her and did like you , then he would have already dumped her for you .
the main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you .
one man willing to move 21 hours/1,400 miles just to be with me .
just want to know have you been to the doc yet !
maybe she 's not a beeeatch and the skinny chick was
get a life and do n't waste mine .
its like if you decide to eat chocalate and then moan cuz u look too fat .
i went and there he was .
if he is , then go for it !
men like this , typically become wife beaters if you do n't obey them !
you like him or you do n't like him ?
but if u are sure then first tell your parents if you havent done allready .
many people will tell you no !
if u think that he feels the same way about you , why not ?
so there are some guys that only say the l word if they mean it .
it defenetely looks like he has feelings for u.do u show how u feel ; ; u should ! !
well i believe everybody should keep their own name .
guys come & go , but friends are forever !
imgaine if it was just considered love ? ?
if your relationship survive the four seasons ... i guess you should be ready ... .
ok now some guy 's like girls like that and some do n't
if you want kids , then homemaker .
should i or should n't i. younger guy vs older woman
of course he wants to go on .
stay true to your husband ... after all , he 's the one you said i do to ...
so it would have to be love .
ur self image is also very important .
im a gilr , i say those things ... .
girls are just as perverted -- trust me .
: ) although , flowers are really nice even if they do n't last .
there are movies that i have n't seen yet .
it is realy sweet and just what u r looking for !
my be she do n't love you but try to use your brean not your haerd
no offense , but it kinda sounds like a girls name ya know but no disrespect intended !
i would n't bother calling him back .
none come in my list so i choose my neighbors wife : d
marriage is really about trusting & communicating
do n't listen to what anyone else tells you to do .
what shuld i do to get her ?
give a rose and express ur love
its unusal yes , but nothing bad .
you have to find whats right for you and your partner/s !
coz they are girls man and they are not as sofisticated as we are !
yes for sure , especially when she throw up ! !
because ... .you know ... ... .try to search you love ... ..but becareful ... .. ! ! ! ! ! !
i ca n't help any more unless i have more infor .
there is n't a wrong or right way to kiss anyone .
do you have to rush your choice ?
having fun with guy friends is ok. 1 .
just think about what you like and do it back for them ... .kinda like a tounge massage .
my boyfriend was definitely my friend first and it is total bliss !
it 's more of a trust issue i 'd say .
i just need someone to help me figer this out
then if he still does n't like you , then move on .
he probably doesnt want to either .
when possible , try to make it yourself .
yeah ok men work and fix things but what else can you do ?
i told her that i loved her and truly meant it .
all seniors think freshman girls are easy , its sad but true
so how do i just kiss him
go to deleted items and it should be there
i hope you find a nice girl .
i do n't think it 's good idea , u are not there for this purpose !
the list could go on and on .
brokeback mountain , ok it 's a guy but at least you 'll be happy !
i think as long as you dont base your relationship on sex its ok
i prob will tell her soon cuz shes my best friend ha well any help would be nice .
yes , and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding .
good luck and hang in there .
umm small party for the family
and if you are worried about doing it - performance wise - dont .
i would be , but i 'm just married !
i think it all depends on age , upbringing , .
you both should pick either his or yours once you have kids .
your kid is going to have hard enough time growing up without a dad .
men without hair look like little boys to me , and it 's not sexy at all .
give it a chance because if you break up with them it would be harder to be friends
or ask about the score of last game ?
get rid of the x if you are dating the guy you love right now .
the best way and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married there .
sure let me know more 'bout you
anything bigger than a handful is a waste , probably a size c or d
lie lie lie and then lie some more
they have never proformed before and it doubles the plesure !
wife says , we do n't wear that shit .
we dont no what you look like !
bcozz we always find a life partner therfor we attract with opposite side
lol i think this is better than the one on top of me ...
do n't go anywhere you went with him or her .
talk 2 your best friend and see if its cool
sounds strange but it worked in about 3-5 days for me !
when he teases you about the stupid little things .
no , because i 'm not married yet
lots of men like thick girls , most of them are black .
i love to express my feelings to the ladies with poems , has anybody written one for a special someone .
i have told her i liked her and she said she would want to ruin or friendship .
no and u shouldnt care.if u like him then stay with him .
or does his friends point at you when your with him .
i love them b/c im a guy and i dont have to ask anyone to the dance
if you feel this strongly about it then maybe you should n't get married .
it really depends if someone is vain or not .
move on and find someone who does n't hate you .
you should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will .
so ofcourse i had to ask him if he was blowin me off .
maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking asian girls
whatever you decide , make it completly yours !
tell him you do n't want a real relationship .
if you are happy she should be happy , unless he really is being bad to you .
there is nothing but trouble there !
not always the easiest but they have been pretty good years .
and hes seen me every day for about 4 or 5 years !
imagine that i am that guy and be my girl freind !
it never hurts to be flirty !
but stick with wats inside of u .
best of luck to you both : )
i 've been with this girl for 8 months and we have n't kissed is this bad ?
depends on the woman , it 's better shaved=- )
i think they just look better than a whole lot of nations out there .
even the day after would be okay .
then see if shes open for a dinner & a movie .
yes some men get right down to it with absolutly no thought for the woman .
ask in english terms ... can not understand you
sorry , i never have felt that way !
remember , no bird ever flew on one wing ! !
i actually ponder this one now and again .
u seem desperate and you 'll never find a if you 're desperate .
imet a girl and i want to know how to know if shes into me or not
but do n't just sit around waiting for the phone to ring .
shut the hell up and be gay if you want to ! ! !
many women 22 are dating men 27 so the 22 yo men feel insecure and have to fish downstream
if he comes to his senses then great if not screw him ! !
i mean if u love him and he really loves u he may want to disapoint his father .
( saying sorry to him without commiting a mistake is humilation to ur self ... and do n't ever get weak ! ! )
do it before it is to late
this gal does not want a bad boy at all .
i`d like to see what a black female has to say about this .
help me win this debate with her !
most often ( not always ) that will be guys around your age , give ot take .
when will people in this effed up world finally realize this ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? !
and i dont know what i should do .
you go to a bar and get drunk !
i did this with my current boyfriend .
no , not if you have to ask ...
rather than just sit there and wait till u are a good one .
( and now even in devorce im stuck with it !
you 'll be fine just have fun !
your girlfriend will just think you 're a jerk .
her parents ? u ca n't fix it ... her friends ? maybe u can talk to them nicely ... but , pls specify , why ?
now me , i would n't marry any women who did n't want to change her name , but that is just me .
maybe you should try dating girls if guys offend you so .
my ex of 3 years cheated .
time wiil tell give it six months and see what happens .
well , the one i liked goes like this .
not all guys get bored and move on .
they 're a lot of fun - there 's plenty to do .
but it is okay to kiss on the first date .
i have a close girl friend .
they are always in the 'in love ' stage .
when he does explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and want him back .
my friend says i am to nice and i should tell them no .
but ( there 's always a but is n't there ?
not all guys , but some guys do
that way you can still go by your last name !
go up to her and say 'hi , are you single ? '
that got me really hot , but i ran off .
however that does not mean that big girls ca n't be cute .
not everyone on here is in school .
practice unwrapping starburst with ur tongue , and tieing cherry stems w/ your tongue .
if you keep talking to him for another week , he might think he is married to you .
me , i 'll pick up the tab if , i can get your vote for best answer .
you should probably be looking in a public place where you are most comfortable .
flirt and see how he reponds
plus it takes the pressure off of me to ask someone ...
say will u go out with me ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
( i mess up alot at times ) but she do n't forget .
is how should i approach her and be not just another guy hitting on her ?
as a guy - let me say this .
you 're 13 do n't even worry about it ...
always trail ride with a friend .
if you guys truely love each other then u can work out all the fighting etc .
its all in the eye contact
yup , i can lift him , he 's only 185 ... .lol
he just has to start over and earn your trust again .
listen it aint that easy.i got with my ex-boyfriend in 2nd grade , then again in 4th , and again in 8th .
sak her out what 's up with that ?
well i hope you read this really well .
play a truth or dare game together
wait until you find that out for sure first and then go from there !
stupid u need a theory class 4 that ! ! ! ! ! ! !
if you do eat something like that then just quit .
now i keep thinking of getting it on with a girl .
confront him and ask him that way you will know
yes jaime is going to ask rubi out ... . but it is not yoru business ...
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits
may be its interesting for them
he dribbles ... he shoots ... he scores ... 2 points ...
or do guys really do prefer bigger women ?
he loves you , too , girl ... time will tell .
if a guy really respects u then he 'll understand .
this is sin , our selves have started this
his answer is good enough for me ...
move on , but you can still luv him ! !
intellect - a chick with brains is just sexy !
i like older girls so i think this is sick and wrong that they cant go out with her
when my sis kisses someone she closes her eyes to get ready .
my last bf i met driving round a roundabout in another car ! !
but he is getting married this month .
should i just forget it and move on ?
replaying everything you ever did to me ?
okay well first thing it sounds as if you guys are already married ! .
first of all , why did u guys break up ?
maybe if you give him space he will eventually call you back .
tell more ppl ( my bor did )
so just take it day by day-step by step.think of how he lost a good thing .
say hey ( whateverhisnameis ) when ya taking me to dinner ? ? ?
no , not if you have to ask .
go to school you can still come home or call your family and friends .
i never wanted to have sex again .
let him make the first move if u do it may make u look like ur ubsesd with him !
some people choose not to because of thier religion , others do n't .
you should be proud of yourself .
so , no i feel its a choice and one does what feels comfortable to them .
you got ta think about that and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust him !
i do n't mean , do you think women are sexy and beautiful .
just tell them , what are they gon na do , slap you ? ?
sound like you like to sell yourself to much .
see if he is willing to go out the way for you .
but it does n't mean you can not love another .
how would anyone know if they do n't know anything about you ?
who gives a crap what anyone else thinks .
if you could have 4 qualities in your woman , what would they be .
we like it when guys do things for us and think about us .
i feel goofy , dorky , and happy .
just keep it cool , a little hard to get might help !
look at the way she walks .
if you two are at a dance , he should n't really care .
gals luv guys with positive self image .
ask her out after class again .
you should go see a shrink !
i think im still totally in love w/ him ...
but thats ok. im a giver.wink , wink .
want to get something you can not get rid of go ahead then
you just have met the dumb ones out there that think skinny is better .
but i am not telling you to be celibate till then ; - )
if he does n't want to dance , then give it up .
hey , i 'm a guy , but i 'll tell you a little .
my girlfriend always says she loves me when were passing notes during class , butshe doesnt say it confrontationally
we ca n't answer if she really means it .
hey i really want to know so please help me out ! !
i have long black hair and i love it , hubby loves it too .
everything seems so open and hit and run with most people these days .
wanting to be something they 're not ?
no you wont huni ... ... i was married to a complete arsehole ! ! ! !
stay away from this guy friend .
i 'm just looking for the girl who wants that time with me
and its been the best thing for at least me .
i met this guy once , very romantic , i met him in this huge rainstorm .
i mean of course you will be making more money if you work hard .
could it ever be the same ...
it could be ( choose one & why ? )
so wait for another 4 years .
either way , best of luck but i 'm just glad that i have brown hair ! !
if your talkin hubby or the like i 'd say tools toys for his vehicle , sports related things .
not what you can become just because she says too .
the problem is that he cheated on me recently and it was the worst that he could of done .
well , if u can imagine ur self with him in bed @ night ! !
it hurt like hell and i bled .
it could probably mean a lot of things .
10 years gap is just nice .
stick yourself out there more , you have to do far more than eye contact
you want all your friends forever ? )
and i hate him for it .
but , i know exactly what i want in a relationship .
in the middle of the river while there was ppl watching it was actually pretty fuuny ! !
if yor hott too show him your boobies
so its natural with that guy .
i see a malaysia air ad on tv and i go gaga .
go out & do everything you could n't when you were with him/her !
yes it is very possible to enjoy giving pleasure rather then recieving it
its been half a year- is it normal 2 still like him ? ?
if you start to feel the it comming on then start the four play again .
guys will think youre hot no matter what with this usually .
it is absolutely just a challenge ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
everywhere ... . just ask any girl passing by ... . but only in thailand ... . not in us ... . lol
is very important to last at least 30-45 minutes ! ! !
problem is i really like him .
cause it 's buy one take one .
wow i did n't think pakistan is that conservative .
we can restle around and be the best of friends .
i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima t my brothers basketball games .
you did n't give us very good information/ do you all live in one house .
... .. you tell her why you like her !
its one way of saying i do n't like you !
hey , its like , everyone 's got ta seperate some day or the other .
i even worked there for awhile and met the man of my dreams .
i 'll probably go and see one .
why wait , , , , , go ahead do it
girl there are more guys out there that love thick girls than u think ?
it really was a casual aside when i said it -- i did n't think he would remember .
girls do n't like guys who is all about themselves .
yes there are you just have to look .
depending on the age , cds or dvds .
both of u work hard to get it right ! !
if she 's interested she 'll call later .
i really care about you and i ca n't stop thinking about you .
overtime should i give him another chance ?
if you feel your love is fading , do n't just sit there and do nothing !
do n't know , but daniel k has never read manga .
try using some of these , but only if they actually apply ! ! !
and i hear ya fountain ... same thing happened to me .
or that she just wants to see other people ?
pick the one you like the most .
just be prepared to let her go .
i have a problem of unloading all my junk up front and maybe i told this guy to much .
i guess its normal , but id just move on
just get rid of him you will be better off
sometimes but you have to observe the one you call your man .
or if he gets them first , you get the popcorn .
and so what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you ?
my girlfriend 's the nuttiest , but i love her anyway .
u 'll find a man who really deserves u one day ) .
be strong , and hang in there .
or , what about blue and green ?
some guys do ... and some guys do n't .
generally kind and my fifth : i 'll just be dissapointed if she 's stupid .
it 's not that bad ... at least it is not bella
i hoping for at least a 90 % but realistically i think its more like 70 % or 65 % .
think about what good it brought about .
i do not know what she wants .
my bff hates my b/f and wishes for me to break up w/ him but i wo n't .
we was hangin out a lil .
you still released at least a thousand !
all my friends want to do is makeout !
happy birth day to you .
because women think with their brains .
complement her ... ask her name ... dont act weird ... act like u r the smoothest guy ever .
after how much time can you conclude that it takes too long and she is n't really interested ?
girls do n't think it 's cool , they think it 's guys who smoke are pathetic cos they are killing themselves
so i 'm only myself around guys i dont like , and you know the outcome .
the timing just wasnt right for it with the old guy ... you 'll see !
take them both out at the same time
i am the maid of honor for my only sister and i want it to be perfect !
my boyfriend snores and i have the most terrible time sleeping !
why does it matter what they think if they dont get along dont spend time togather .
if you want your girlfriend forever ... ... ... .then just do n't let her know that you want her forever , simple .
if she is calling just to bablle then tell her to not call you so often !
i have to stop right away because i 'm ready to relieve myself .
for me anything after 3 days and i might start to forget about you .
or just you wan na say that ! ?
i agree with the other preson before anyone gets hurt
people do n't like to be played yo-yo with .
who knows but i would absouletly love that 2 be done 2 me .
and impress her with affection and love .
man has penis and woman has clitoris .
by now , you might love your wife for everything you guys have endured .
i do n't need a trophy girl i want a companion .
i hate it my self , i love the straight ones
if shae like him then there is a reson .
there no one you can trust more than a good friend !
thats weird but maybe idk ill talk to my friend by his locker .
if your the average guy breast size should n't matter .
i am man and i too feel so ... . because i too am ! ! !
try to contact their q & a team..they 'll help you through..have a nice day !
i like intelligent , fun and hot girls .
hell yeah for the first answer.that girl answered for me .
if he/she want to see you picture rightaway it sex !
uh- wher 've u been meeting these filipinas ?
maybe ask him out to lunch or a movie or somthing .
no i haven't..i prefer normal-looking guys
i had someone get nasty with me because i was still dating ?
i 'm ready to move on , but i love him way too much !
yea ask for permission by all means and watch how fast she slap the s -- - out you
guys think that they are special , and that they are only good enough for certain girls .
depends , some days i want to have sex , somedays i do n't .
this is just what i have nurt many times .
it just sounds like u wear the pants .
hang in there for one that apprecaites you .
do n't come here , it smells like a trap to me .
smaller of course , and it is all about looks ! !
sweetheart let him go , if he is ment to be with u he will come back to you
the guy i like is mad at me .
so - u like asian food ?
my cuzin met up with some wierd old perv saying he was a hot teen that she met online
if you have to ask , then you are not in love .
dont even listen to what people not just guys say , watch how they act .
its ur personalitie , keep to it , whether a guy goes out with u shouldnt determin how u act .
i still love him what to do
just talk your spouse about this
if you flirt with him , the challange is not there .
or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances ...
you are killing the romance by popping up that stupid question , ever thought of having fun together instead ?
also actual kissing and asking if your a good kisser ...
haha julesac is funny , but mean .
see my boyfriend ( go to my 360 ) ?
the fact that a guy is sooo self centered is a huge turn off for me .
i know because i am just like your wife .
if u have to ask other people i really dont think ur ready to
rip off your shirt and do a tarzan yell .
unless you dont love your husband anymore and you have room for another man ? ? ? ?
compliments , honesty and make it about her .
i 'm into a 6th grade boy too !
beacuse they feel insecure with less educated guys ... ... ... .
maybe you and i can get together sometime & we 'll find love with one another .
if she will tell the administration i will be expelled coz its pakistan not america
my friend has a bf who she talks 2 online and on the phone .
but cuddling up with a large women is one of the best feelings i know of .
i think the bomb is much easier ! !
one his side of his family i met his father .
anything that is not nailed down !
be her friend first then see where it goes
i was cheated on for 3 of the years .
jump him because she likes him ? ?
dont tell them but let them find out once your in bed with her .
here in america it is not so important ...
be confident , always believe in yourself.do not be arrogant though.always make good eye contact.listen to what she has to say .
let it take it 's course from there .
i dated one and i know .
i wish i had listened to my friends
if he does n't start acting right , then leave him .
just do what makes you happy !
we tried to move on but it did n't work .
if you dont ask sombody else might .
my twin wont talk or listen to me
most girls are polite she 'll answer it
you married him and it was for a reason .
just face him , say hey i like you wan na see a movie ?
some woman can not seem to find guys their own age attractive .
but that didnt bother me , because like i said wa & # 92 ; e were just friends .
in that case tkake some defense classes .
at least thats what it seems like to me .
how drunk is this girl getting ?
u should take the time to get to know both of them equally without goin out with them .
do you know he loves you ?
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat
those was good times i tells ya .
if your a hoe then he 's one to ... i personally do n't think your one tho
because the white women are taking up all the men ! !
ofcourse , if she calls like 5 times a day about that , then it would be crazy .
either that or you are the only one he has a chance at getting some booty from
tell the bastard to get out .
good god how old are you ?
they think that they can control other peoples lives when thye cant
if you really love him , you would let him go ...
someone i can be myself with .
the rest is easy from there ! !
say i love you and if the wait to say it back it tells it all
i just got out of a 3 yr relationship with my baby 's father .
good luck in your search for the one !
after i while i t passes and i still love him
look , he already knows that you like him , and has he said anything bad about it ?
some women like big hairy guys , some guys like fat women , some gals like skinny guys , and vice-versa .
my wife forgives me for alot of things .
what if you tell him that you just want to be friends with benefits .
i like him and he says stuff like , if i were n't dating _ i would go out with you ?
they are often worse than men ! ! !
is she just trying to use you ?
dont do things tht can get you hurt .
you would be genuinly suprised in the type of people that go to them .
wait till you get 25. you would not loose your charm by then .
so if you 're set on that , that 's the way to go ! !
so thats why i ask why dont guyz ever know what they want with any kinda relationship ! ? ! ? !
if you need your x emotionally - then ya got some troubles .
but really if you 're used to it and you kinda like it , go with it .
remember , till death do you part ! !
wit her takin ur number , there 's nothing wrong wit that .
if yes , why do i heard some girl said flowers ar not going to last ?
and do n't start with her looks , mister !
if you two are serious then asking her that question should n't bother her .
the pictures i 've seen ... i would say maui or the bahamas .
the problem is not if u ask her while at work or not .
it was really nice how he asked me out .
what a typical double standard you have set up ! !
i cant give you a wife view but hopefully mine is just as good .
yes be disappointed and be mad ! !
there was his stop so he got off the train .
20 years down the road that is all you can be so start from the beginning
do n't be afraid to say no .
leave it alone-i do n't care what she says , she 's in enough pain .
for one thing if it does n't work out there goes your job .
going to a club and dancing .
man how many times i passed up a great oppertunity by worrying about someone saying no ... ...
how do i get he to stop nagging me and leave me alone .
when you 18 or 20 because when they said something they dont mean it
i would wonder why he shaved them but , in the end , they 're his legs !
be really nice and give eye contact and smile a lot.. hope this helps !
i am just curious to what everyone thinks .
for the guys : ( a ) do you prefer a bigger woman or a smaller woman ?
she definitely wants you to think she 's good looking , but she does n't want that to be reason # 1 .
only that i can say : good luck !
i only once told a girl that i loved her , and i meant it .
then go pick them up ( if she say yes ) .
chances r , if u like her as a friend , ull like her as more .
keeping secrets only hurt the ones you love .
be you show a little toghness thats what girls like atleast most of them but mostly be yourself
do n't worry what people will say .
and any guy who sas he woul is prolly not being entirely honest with himself .
let him go ... either that or date his brother !
death is like a box full of candy corn
some do , but i would rather have a pair that were not too big
others like think due to society dictates its ; i say screw society and give me thick !
that only makes her easier to bed .
if you like him that much , call him .
b/c you dont have any decision power what to do
it 's your own life , as you said .
keep getting her younger and younger guys as one gets old get a new one for her ...
ps im not a stay at home romantic dinner type of girl .
am doing this just for the points lol
thats a chance your gon na have to take .
work at it but do n't let him keep you locked up at home .
whatever you do ... do not tell him too soon ! ! !
i dont think it is wise to date at work .
if going to a movie is special for the 2 of you , then do that .
it comes right after threeplay and before fiveplay .
a sex toy , that way you can both enjoy it .
its a man thing live with it ego
i totally agree with udaman ... good luck girl
i like him alot and i want to win him over not push him away .
only i am not thinking about him but i am having dreams about him .
least not till he gets another girlfriend .
play the field a bit now .
i always say that you should n't do things if your gon na regret them later .
the safest rules of internet dating are these : 1. chat via email and messenger 2. chat on the phone .
yes i have done it it was a lot of fun .
there are tons of cheap ideas out there , just find what you like and work with it !
so you might just be over looking the type of men who think the world of you..
keep seaching for a believer in romance , she 's out there !
when you can fart in front of the one your dating
i hope i see some of it soon .
well just go up to her .
well i dont no how old you are which would help .
yes it is a sick habit
we have no room for screwed up animals like this in our society .
do you mean seem more sexy ?
is this a trick question ?
it 's like saying , what 's got to stop me when i have already done it ?
the right date can save money on lots of things .
thats all i have 2 say .
why ca n't men ( or boys in your case ) ever say the word love ?
and the gf should accept that about if she loves you .
he then asked me , can i come with you ?
a lot of guys like that - just looking for sex .
a spasm in your back usually
i dont think so , maybe they should try taking our last names
becuz if you do then your gon na lose your friend over a guy ! ! ! !
if he likes you , you 'll know !
they like the challange i know thats what i love about it
if she likes music , make a special cd or tape .
but i need to be happy .
do not try to have sex .
when i fall in love , i feel stupid .
is worth the wait when you are ready .
you are too good for them
' ... does this mean he likes me ? .
but you know what , i feel the guy should make the first move .
if i would 've kept my last name its just a freakin name .
seperate the bad thing and move on !
> > other than those two things , just ask him once in a while .
look , try and get out to meet people .
i 'm still in love with my ex and i 'm so mad at my cousin because my ex likes her .
so it was a good ideea !
celebrate valentine with joy and fun ... give eachother gifts and hav a fun ...
not for anything but lookin at
oh yes , the trick ass hoe 's never had a chance .
but i think they both like me .
cuz they like the little titis and pussys
dont forget to choose and vote for best answer ! ! !
i 've been with my husband for 4 years we recently got married in december of 2005 .
nay pier is a great place or one of the museums ... .there r alot of great resteraunts of hotels .
well , in my experience , a lot of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other .
do n't worry , i aint working with much either .
my mom books them all of the time pat @ alanatvl.com
it 's been over 6 months & i ca n't seem to get over it .
tell her to move to mass ... ... ... ... .
to me it realy dose'nt matter , but a hand full is quite enought for me .
some girls prefer gifts that wo n't die on them ... something that lasts .
she 's strong and loving and most of all ... really was n't as happy as she thought she was .
if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young .
size , shape , looks , ect should not matter at all ...
about what they think about gay marrige/ relationshiops ?
i agree , just kiss him ... he 'll respond one way or another .
he handed me his cellphone and had me put in my phone number .
if you want to enjoy a bit - why do n't you check out some restaurants , night clubs , gyms etc
so id say , they do work out , just not a lot of the times ... hope this helps ...
yah look me up if you are ever in florida lol ! ! !
be cool and ask her on a date !
hey im sorry i do n't know and i wish best of luck to both of you !
hello : i am looking to visit your country .
look for another hot girl , so she will be jealous .
child please , dont ask that question if you dont want your feelings hurt
i do not know what to do because she knows how much i care about him .
and last but not least -- - does he always just happen to be staring ... ?
slow down the pace maybe , fourplay ,
depends on the girl i guess ... fair skinned females look extra pale when they have black hair .
i was not gon na let her win .
never tell her she 's fat big one ! ! !
what happened when the politician took viagra ?
you know that 's if u did n't play the guilt trip .
it sounds like he is having too much fun while you are away .
ummm yes i do i think anyone does ! !
because some couples never get to that comfortable boring stage .
obviously , men ai n't much better ; - )
i never went out with him a second time .
maybe because your the most beautiful girl they have seen .
u need to be wit that person , you have found your true love
if the guy is worthy enough , u wont need to
your too young to be talking about kissing already .
first you order one online and the stork brings one to you
just on a much harsher scale as time goes on .
just move on with your life and frind some one eles !
depends on how old they are .
well all ur missing is a million dollar smile.. : )
well basically you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him
the girls that whine that flowers do n't last are just ungrateful .
haha thats why i am single !
the girlz that are pretty or have a great personality .
altho , i dont really like girls all that much .
cut your cousin an your ex boyfriend off complete .
i dont ever remember giving a girl a cristmas gift unless i liked her .
whos to say that country girls feel more sexy ?
well i met mine in a carnival .
honey my husband likes me for me .
nope , she is not a liar .
if they do n't , it 's time to move on .
figure out what style of arrangements you would like and flowers .
as long as he dosent mind , who elses opinion matters ?
you 're probably just too good for him anyway .
and she still lets me play with my trucks and watch cartoons ! ! ! ! !
lime green would be more for a summer wedding .
i do n't know can i do anything about it ?
that 's right , the right relationship happened on it 's own .
looks do n't really matter unless you are trying to prove something .
please be honest with me i can handle the truth
start the day off with breakfast out ... then perhaps a nice walk .
i did this before ( accidentally ) and my friend was mad that i deleted him !
yes , girl down there , do n't have sex .
ok , tell her , but be as polite as possible .
no.u guys kiss when ur ready
ask her questions ( do n't just talk ) .
i think you are probaly a nice guy and she probaly loves you alot .
when she calls , text her back
no ! no ! no ! it certainly is most uncool.u r simply wasting ur health cos girls just hate it .
find someone u like and say will u be my valentine !
tell her that you miss her and that you love her .
if nothing work ... u have to ask him for it again : - )
some do , some do n't have it in them .
he wont turn you down .
no brainer oh and nice picture of george clooney on your profile lmao
he wants me to change how i look .
ok , those other replies are just cocky , i 'm way more fine .
bad teeth , bad breath and bad bo .
there are not any words that are going to make it any better .
dang it , if only every man knew what women want the world would be a much happier place ! ! !
and you want to suck another man 's d**k ? ? ?
you people have no right to get married !
yeah , im a guy so i dont really have to pay .
you know ... ... .if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do is ask ... ... .sheesh !
